Version "0.1": January 15, 2017
  - Initial version with documented updates.


Version "0.1.1": January 15, 2017
  - In the summary.jl file, functionality was changed so it's easier to create
    an empty file to quickly check which scenario was run.


Version "0.2.0": January 24, 2017
  - Fixed an error with harvest. When passing an effort variable with a length
    less than the number of years in a simulation there was no
    ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception reported so harvest was only applied in the
    years less than the length of the effort variable array.
  - This bug has been fixed by changing the arguments in simulate.jl -> simulate
    and mortality.jl -> harvest!


Version "0.2.1": January 27, 2017
  - Switched the function signatures in the functions FileIO.jl -> simReadme and
    summary.jl -> simSummary.
  - This fixed a bug that occurs when writing the files to summarize simulation
    results. Data types switched from an array of Int64 to an array of Float64.

Version "0.2.2": January 29, 2017
  - Fixed deprecated syntax for Julia v0.5.0, ASCIIString -> String types.
